# Project 1


## 1. Specifications
This game will consist of a player controlling a small square by moving his or her mouse. There will be an NPC (Non-Playable Character) chasing the players mouse and will attempt to touch the players mouse/square with its own square. The player will have 3 lives and will need to run away from the NPC for as long as possible but as soon as the players is touched 3 times the game will end.

## 2. Epics/Requirements
#### Non Functional Epics/Requirements
There will be a pure white screen that has the title 'TraceBall' with a small blue button below it that the player will click to start the game, which will start immediately.

The game will have a pure white backgroud with a pure black border surrounding it. This is to make sure the players knows the space they have to play. While the player is trying to escape they will be focusing on the NPC and their own square and either will not want to look away or will want to take a quick glance at the space they have. Using a strong, visible colour like black gives the player and easier time looking at the space they have with their quick glance. 

The game will contain two squares, one that is an NPC and another which will be the player. There will be two coloured squares, one for the NPC square and one for the player square; so the player knows which square they are. The NPC square which will be red to indicate it being the enemy, and the player's square will be blue to indicate that is it friendly.

#### Functional Epics/Requirements
Create the game screen in the top left of the screen taking up a space of 600px X 600px, which is a perfect size for the game as it is big enough to not strain the players eyes trying to look at a small box and small enough so it is not completely in your face and unnecessarily huge. Additionally, this size is perfect for a game of this nature, as games like this are enjoyable because of their simplicity; and this size provides that.

Create a button that will start the game. This will be a small blue button that the player will press that will start the game.

Create a pure white screen for the blue button to be on.

Create a title on the pure white screen that read 'TraceBall'

Create a collision detection for both squares. This will indicate to the player that they have been hit. This will be shown as the blue square turning red to indicate the player's square has been 'hit'/'hurt' (this is why it turns red) and the game will reset back to the start, where the game will start instantaneously, with 2 lives and so on until the player loses all 3 lives.

Create a blue square that will be controlled by the player's mouse movements. This square will react instantly to the player's mouse movements so the player has complete control over their square.

Create a red square that an NPC (Non-Playable Charater) will control. This square move at a slower speed to make sure it does not instantly catch the player. The NPC will follow the players square and try to collide with it 3 times to end the game.
